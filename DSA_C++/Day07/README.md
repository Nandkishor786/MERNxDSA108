🚀 Day 07 — Minimum Pair Removal to Sort Array
📌 Problems Covered
1️⃣ Problem: Minimum Pair Removal to Sort Array

Given an array nums, repeatedly select the leftmost adjacent pair with minimum sum and replace it with their sum until the array becomes non-decreasing.

Goal: Count the minimum number of operations needed to sort the array.

✅ Learned how greedy strategy can minimize operations and how to track indices and update arrays in-place efficiently.

🎯 Key Takeaways

Practiced array manipulation & greedy approach in C++.

Learned how index tracking & in-place updates ensures correctness.

Strengthened understanding of greedy strategies to minimize operations.

Time Complexity: O(n²) → Because we repeatedly scan array for minimum sum pair

Space Complexity: O(1) → In-place updates, no extra storage
