# 🚀 Day 04 — Linked List Problem Solving

## 📌 Problems Covered

---

### 1️⃣ Remove Elements from Linked List
- Implemented an algorithm to **delete all nodes with a specific value**.
- Carefully handled **head node deletion** and pointer updates (`prev` & `curr`).
- Improved **debugging skills** for memory management during node deletion.

---

### 2️⃣ Intersection of Two Linked Lists
- First solved using an **unordered_map** to track visited nodes.
- Then optimized using a **two-pointer approach (O(1) space)**, where both pointers traverse both lists and eventually:
  - Meet at the **intersection node**, OR  
  - End at `nullptr` if no intersection exists.

## 🎯 Key Learnings
- Gained better understanding of **edge cases** in linked list problems.
- Improved confidence with **pointer manipulation & dynamic memory**.
- Learned how both **hash maps** and **two-pointer techniques** solve the same problem — tradeoff between **space & efficiency**.
