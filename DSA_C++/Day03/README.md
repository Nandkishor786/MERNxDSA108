# 🚀 Day 3 of #MERNxDSA: 108 Days to Mastery — Progress Update!


Today, I continued my DSA journey with C++ by solving 3 problems on **LeetCode**, focusing on linked lists and cycle detection:

### 🔗 Merge Two Sorted Lists
- Implemented both iterative and recursive solutions.  
- Learned how to efficiently merge nodes while handling different lengths and edge cases.

### ♻️ Remove Duplicates from Sorted List
- Optimized approach without using extra space.  
- Strengthened concepts of pointer manipulation in linked lists.

### 🌀 Linked List Cycle Detection (Floyd’s Cycle Algorithm)
- Practiced using fast and slow pointers.  
- Learned how to detect cycles in O(n) time and O(1) space.

Each problem helped me deepen my understanding of **pointers, memory handling, and edge case analysis** in linked list problems.
