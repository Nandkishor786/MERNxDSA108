# 📘 Day 01: Singly Linked List

This folder contains my implementation and exploration of the **Singly Linked List** data structure as part of my daily DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) practice.

---

## 📌 What is a Singly Linked List?

A **Singly Linked List** is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains:

- A **value** (data)
- A **pointer** (or reference) to the **next node**

Unlike arrays, linked lists are **not stored in contiguous memory**, and elements are **dynamically allocated**.

# 📘 Day 01: Singly Linked List – Insertion & Deletion

This folder contains my implementation of the **Singly Linked List** data structure with a focus on:

- Insertion (at head, tail, and specific position)
- Deletion (by value or position)

---

## 🔧 Operations Implemented

### ✅ Insertion

- `insert_at_head(data)` – Insert a new node at the beginning
- `insert_at_tail(data)` – Insert at the end of the list
- `insert_at_position(pos, data)` – Insert at a specific position

### ❌ Deletion

- `delete_at_position(pos)` – Delete node at a specific index
