# 🚀 Day 05 — Linked List Advanced Problems

## 📌 Problems Covered

---

### 1️⃣ Middle of Linked List

- Implemented the **fast & slow pointer technique (Tortoise-Hare)** to find the middle node in O(n).
- Learned how to handle **odd vs even length lists**.
- Key Takeaway: Always check **edge cases** (0 or 1 node) to avoid runtime errors.

### 2️⃣ Palindrome Linked List

- Reversed the **second half of the list** and compared node-by-node with the first half.
- Successfully restored the list back after comparison to maintain structure.
- Learned how **recursion + two-pointer** technique helps solve linked list problems effectively.
