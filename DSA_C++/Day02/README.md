# ðŸš€ Day 2 of #MERNxDSA: 108 Days to Mastery â€” Progress Update!

Today, I tackled some foundational **DSA problems** and sharpened my problem-solving skills with **C++**:

---

## ðŸ”„ Recursive Linked List Reversal

- Implemented a **recursive approach** to reverse a singly linked list.
- Managed **head and tail pointers** efficiently.
- Practiced **base cases** and recursive transformations.

## ðŸ”¢ Two Sum Problem

- âœ… **Brute Force:** Solved with nested loops â†’ `O(nÂ²)`.
- âš¡ **Optimized:** Used a **hash map (`unordered_map`)** â†’ `O(n)`.
- Key takeaway: **hash-based lookups** make problem-solving faster and cleaner.

## ðŸŒ€ Spiral Matrix Traversal

- Designed an algorithm to print elements of a 2D matrix in **spiral order**.
- Used boundary pointers: `minr, maxr, minc, maxc`.
- Added a **count tracker** to stop exactly after all elements are covered.
